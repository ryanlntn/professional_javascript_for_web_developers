// Chapter 1
// What is JavaScript?

// History
  // JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape.
  // Soon after introducing it Microsoft released their own version.
  // This caused all sorts of problems so it was decided that they
  // would standardize.

  // Long story short, we now have ECMAScript 5.

// Implementations
  // JavaScript consists of three main parts:
    // 1. The ECMAScript Core Language
    // 2. The Document Object Model (DOM)
    // 3. The Browser Object Model (BOM)

  // ECMAScript describes the:
    // ➤ Syntax
    // ➤ Types
    // ➤ Statements
    // ➤ Keywords
    // ➤ Reserved words
    // ➤ Operators
    // ➤ Objects

  // of the JavaScript language.

  // The DOM is an API for accessing and manipulating the HTML document.
    // It's implemented differently on a browser by browser basis though
    // it's becoming more standardized lately.

  // The BOM is an API for accessing and manipulating the browser window.
    // It's implemented differently on a browser by browser basis though
    // it's becoming more standardized lately.

// JavaScript Version Numbers
  // Vary browser by browser and so are mostly meaningless.
